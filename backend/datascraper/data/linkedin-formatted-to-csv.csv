Subsequent efforts to focus on the world’s main anti-poverty targets, the Millennium Development Goals, have generated more than $60 billion in pledges, with a special emphasis on Africa and the new Global Strategy on Women’s and Children’s Health. Empowering women The Secretary-General pressed successfully for the creation of UN Women, a major new agency that consolidates the UN’s work in this area. His advocacy for women’s rights and gender equality has also included the "Unite to End Violence against Women" campaign and the establishment of a new Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict. Within the UN itself, the Secretary-General has increased the number of women in senior management positions by more than 40 per cent, reaching the highest level in the Organization’s history. Supporting countries facing crisis or instability The Secretary-General has sought to strengthen UN peace efforts, including through the New Horizons peacekeeping initiative, the Global Field Support Strategy and the Civilian Capacity Review, a package of steps to improve the impact of the 120,000 United Nations "blue helmets" operating in the world’s conflict zones. Generating new momentum on disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation The Secretary-General has sought to rejuvenate the disarmament agenda through a five-point plan, efforts to break the deadlock at the Conference on Disarmament and renewed attention to nuclear safety and security in the aftermath of the tragedy at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Strengthening the UN The Secretary-General has introduced new measures aimed at making the United Nations more transparent, effective and efficient.",

Everything from what a day to day would look like to what our grading system would entail. I put a few lectures together including the interaction design section. I hosted informal lectures on software programs including OmniGraffle, Photoshop and even Hype (which I ended up teaching myself in 2 days to then teach to 21 students!).

We started it since there was so much demand for mobile app development and we were right in the heart of it with working on our own product (SitOrSquat) while teaming up with Charmin to promote them into our app (before we sold it to them in 2010). I lead the design team while working closely with the developers as well to assure there was a steam lined approach to the process in making mobile apps and dynamic websites. Some notable products we created were: MateMate (matemate.com iPhone app) An internal product which redesigned the way people look at public transportation apps throughout a number of large US cities. At the time, there weren't a ton of beautifully designed options. We decided to make our own. It received a ton of traction. Personally, I still use the NYC Mate app to this day as my primary NYC subway app. Pampers My Baby Registry (pampersmybabyregistry.com, iPhone app, Blackberry app, Facebook app) Lead a team of designers to flush out a large scale project for Pampers in an extremely tight deadline.

As I pitched the idea to developers, I kept working on the project and accumulating data (public bathrooms). When I found my tech guy, things moved super fast from there. We created a dynamic site which allowed users to access information (again, public bathrooms) as well as upload new information. We quickly got an iPhone app into the store when the app store was still at it's infancy. The BlackBerry App and WAP text messaging service quickly followed as well as providing a White Label solution. All this was done in a 2 person designer/developer team. I managed to do most of the initial work in my off hours while still at my full time job. The success and my excitement of this product convinced me to leave the print world altogether and get 100% immersed into digital. To throw out a few statistics: We accumulated 20,000 users in less than the first month. Upon selling the product to Proctor & Gamble (to the Charmin Brand) in 2010, we had accumulated over 100,000 user generated bathrooms worldwide and had reached 2 million downloads in the App stores.",

They know that a strong Intellectual Property program helps them attract investors and provides them with a market advantage. These companies have many IP issues to deal with, including developing and executing a coherent IP strategy, preparing for investor diligence, and clearing barriers to market entry. Company management needs someone who can work closely with them to address these challenges. Outside counsel at large law firms can be too expensive and remote to give biotech companies the attention they need, but hiring full-time in-house IP counsel isn’t the right solution. I solve the IP challenges of small biotech companies by serving as their part-time in-house IP counsel. We work face-to-face with management to develop and manage an effective IP program. Companies can rely on our reputation, credentials and twenty-five years of experience in biotech and pharmaceutical IP. Our services are more cost-effective than outside counsel in large law firms. Our clients feel that they have a trusted partner at their side, and they have confidence that their IP program is in good hands.

I speak at conferences and meetups to educate and engage developers with the LinkedIn API and to provide a broad overview of the many things LinkedIn is currently doing. My talks are generally an overview of our platform with hands on code samples showing real functionality (even including a little live coding if I am feeling adventurous). I try to demonstrate real world functionality, rather than generic "Hello World" type tutorials, so they provide the most impact possible to interested developers. Documentation is a critical facet of developer support. I write and update documentation on our Developer Portal, including tutorials, reference materials and example code. I also was actively involved in the move of our developer portal from Jive to Drupal, including the writing of several custom Drupal modules and extensive configuration and debugging work. One very important aspect of developer relations is to facilitate communication between the developer community and our product teams. Our team listens to the feedback and wishlists from our developers and communicates that to the product teams - and I also participate in design and development discussions to ensure the quality of new features and improvements. At the end of the day, I am not successful unless our partners are successful, so I work with our LinkedIn partners as much as possible to help them develop excellent LinkedIn applications using our API.",

Why should you care that I’m a “spokesmodel” for this organization? With youthful curiosity, I work to accept my humanity. I seem to ask questions, think, and believe a little differently than my peers. Despite having aggressive, incredibly painful and debilitating Rheumatoid Arthritis (Rheumatoid Autoimmune Disorder or RAD), continued enthusiasm and sincerity link me to everyone I meet. I am a survivor of multiple, complex, chronic medical conditions and a near-fatal motorcycle wreck. With encouragement, I try to be bravely open and vulnerable about insights, as I inspire others to live their passions encouraging trans-formative change in my community of friends, fans and clients. When I appeared at Internet Prophets Live in Chicago, April 2013, I met the Marketing Director of this foundation. We exchanged cards and promised each other a follow-up call. I asked why Derek was attending and he responded that, as the Marketing Director, he wanted to learn to use every tool he could to help spread awareness, positively impact funding, and make a change in the lives of people like me who were affected by this and other forms of Arthritis. The Arthritis National Research Foundation (ANRF) funds scientists to cure arthritis by discovering the causes of arthritis and its related diseases including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, juvenile arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. I wanted to raise my own bar on how I share and support causes I believe in, so we have agreed to work together to achieve the goals of the organization and to positively impact millions of lives.",

La Fontaine not only helps keep my skin younger-looking, soft and supple, this product protects me from what would otherwise be a skin-damaging strict medical protocol. Dermal Life was founded with a mission to develop advanced skin care products that maximize skin health. Americans spend an estimated $55 billion on skin care annually. Major skin care problems include sunburns, burns, rosacea, dermatitis, chronic wounds, and skin damage caused by age and environmental factors. Dermal Life has developed a generic brand of a classic French remedy that is recommended by French dermatologists, sold in most French apothecaries and used in 70% of French households. Our Hydropermeate Topical emulsion received FDA clearance in May 2013 for both prescription and first aid indications. Prescription indications include: 1st and 2nd degree burns including sunburns; radiation dermatitis; full thickness wounds, pressure sores, and dermal ulcers; dermal donor and graft site management; and superficial wounds and minor abrasions. Additionally, Dermal Life launched La FONTAINE Hydration Cream on June 1, 2013. La FONTAINE is scientifically formulated to smooth and lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles caused by sun, the environment, lack of hydration and natural aging. (Trust me: it works!)

With partner Mike O’Neil, I have addressed audiences of over 1,800 on LinkedIn & Social Media. Audiences really like how we bridge Training and Speaking. For us, speaking really is training without a keyboard in hand. We deliver real content, not just inspiration when we speak. Clients tell us their #1 obstacle to successful presentations is lack of attendee follow-up. Hence, we are keenly focused on INSPIRING as we help people understand LinkedIn & Social Media. Our presentations are engaging and conversational with our audience. Being life partners makes it interesting for many as they learn how we make OUR lives work with 24/7 immersion into the Social Media Lifestyle. Our style has been likened to Sony & Cher, Regis & Kathy Lee, and Burns & Allen. Just like a Rock Concert, we get people super excited to learn how they can use LinkedIn & Social Media to drive their performance to higher levels. We have spoken in conferences along with Joel Comm, Tim Ash, Daron Babin, Jeff Mills, Stephen Beck, Larry Loik, Perry Belcher, Joel Bauer, Sam Richter, Ron Davies, Susan Preston, and Heather Lutze.

He is helping shape the global dialogue on what it means to be a person in our digital societies and digital economies and inventing the technologies and informing the intellectual, policy, and business frameworks that will enable a new “person-centered” personal data ecosystem to emerge that better balances the interests of the private sector, the public sector, and the people. Providing a historically and philosophically informed view of today’s internet, Marc has articulated that in terms of political economy we live in an age of “digital feudalism” that needs to be transformed by a “digital enlightenment” brought about by people reclaiming in the online world the human rights, property rights, speech rights, civil society, and democratic governance we achieved in the physical world. Key to this effort is Marc’s work as a founding member of the World Economic Forum Rethinking Personal Data Project and as a member of the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council for Data-Driven Development. This year Marc was featured in the World Economic Forum Global Agenda Outlook 2013 report in a dialogue with Robert Madelin moderated by Rod Beckstrom, which articulated the “Thriving in a Hyperconnected World” theme, and Marc was also selected by the European Commission to respond to the their “Onlife Manifesto: Being human in a hyperconnected era” which is part of the EU’s Digital Agenda for Europe.",

For example, Marc and his team worked on transforming social search by moving Bing from the “Web of Pages” to the “Web of People” so that searching for almost any topic or interest would return friends and other people specifically relevant to the person doing the query. Based on initial prototypes from Marc’s team, the Bing Sidebar connects searchers to the friends and other people relevant to their searches and enables them to communicate with these relevant people to help them get things done. Another social search prototype conceived and developed by Marc and his team, “Bing Linked Pages” enabled people to easily link web pages that are by or about them to their Facebook identity and have these Linked Pages appear in Bing when people searched for them. Bing Linked Pages was described by ReadWrite as “what Google+ should have been.” Klout has now adopted Bing Linked Pages as Klout Tags.

Here a few of my favorite accomplishments thus far while working here: • rest.li: Designed and implemented the initial version of LinkedIn's next-generation RESTful service invocation framework. • Twitter integration: Designed and implemented account linking and bi-directional status synchronization between LinkedIn and Twitter using Twitter's Streaming API, REST APIs and OAuth. • Internal 'firehose': a realtime stream of all updates and activity on LinkedIn, built using Kafka, a high-throughput distributed messaging system (http://sna-projects.com/kafka). This data stream powers LinkedIn Signal and other forthcoming real-time products. • Site-wide sharing: Designed and implemented the new rich sharing module on the home page and a generic 'object sharing' dialog for the rest of the site. This project also included the implementation of our link shortener, lnkd.in. • LinkedIn Groups: Led a small team that took our fledgling Groups product from a simple badge on your profile to a vital professional collaboration space and a major engagement driver for the site • Profile PDF: Exports your LinkedIn profile to a nicely formatted PDF file. I used Apache FOP for PDF rendering. • Scalability: I helped keep the site up through periods of tremendous growth by profiling/tuning code, sharding databases, adding caches, optimizing SQL, diagnosing tricky distributed software issues and more. In addition to coding, I perform code and design reviews, mentor fellow engineers, write copious amounts of wiki documentation and present my work at tech talks and company all-hands meetings. I also spoke at JavaOne 2008 and SD West in 2008/2009, presenting LinkedIn's overall site architecture along with an outline of our engineering process: http://www.slideshare.net/linkedin/linkedins-communication-architecture",

By bridging the gap between different domains we leverage the best of what has already been accomplished to solve problems that some have deemed unsolvable … in essence, “redistributing the future”.
